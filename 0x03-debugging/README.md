# 0x03. C - Debugging

This repository contains solutions to debugging tasks in C programming language. The tasks focus on testing, finding and correcting errors in code.

## Task 0: Multiple mains

In this task, we are provided with a main file to test the `positive_or_negative()` function. The task requires us to create a new file named `0-main.c` that tests the function for the case of 0. We are not required to implement the function, just to test it.

The solution for this task can be found in the `0-main.c` and `main.h` files in the `0x03-debugging` directory.

## Task 1: Like, comment, subscribe

For this task, we are required to copy a main file and comment out the part of the code that is causing an infinite loop. We are not allowed to add or remove any lines of code, just to comment out the existing code.

The solution for this task can be found in the `1-main.c` file in the `0x03-debugging` directory.

## Task 2: 0 > 972?

The goal of this task is to fix the code in `2-largest_number.c` so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers. The solution can be found in the `2-largest_number.c` and `main.h` files in the `0x03-debugging` directory.

## Task 3: Leap year

The task requires us to fix the `print_remaining_days()` function so that it correctly converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration. We are required to ensure that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.

The solution for this task can be found in the `3-print_remaining_days.c` and `main.h` files in the `0x03-debugging` directory.
