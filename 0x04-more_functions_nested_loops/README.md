# 0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops

This repository contains my solutions to the "0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops" project of the Low-level programming & Algorithm curriculum at [ALX](https://www.alxafrica.com/)
## Requirements

* All programs were compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` with flags `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic` and `-std=gnu89` version 5.5.0.
* Code follows the [Betty style](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl).

## Files

The following is a list of the files in this repository and a short description of what they do:

File | Description
--- | ---
0-isupper.c | A function that checks for an uppercase character.
1-isdigit.c | A function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).
2-mul.c | A function that multiplies two integers.
3-print_numbers.c | A function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.
4-print_most_numbers.c | A function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line but does not print 2 and 4.
5-more_numbers.c | A function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line.
6-print_line.c | A function that draws a straight line in the terminal.
7-print_diagonal.c | A function that draws a diagonal line in the terminal.
8-print_square.c | A function that prints a square, followed by a new line.
9-fizz_buzz.c | A function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".
10-print_triangle.c | A function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line.
100-prime_factor.c | A program that finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number 612852475143, followed by a new line.
101-print_number.c | A function that prints an integer.
