## 0x02-functions_nested_loops

This directory contains C programs that demonstrate the use of functions and nested loops. Each program file is named according to the task it performs.

### Files
Below are the files contained in this directory and a brief description of what each one does:

- `0-putchar.c`: This program prints `_putchar`, followed by a new line.

- `1-alphabet.c`: This program prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line. It uses the `_putchar` function to output each character.

- `2-print_alphabet_x10.c`: This program prints the alphabet in lowercase 10 times, each on a new line. It uses a nested loop to achieve this and the `_putchar` function to output each character.

- `3-islower.c`: This program defines a function that checks if a given character is lowercase or not. It returns 1 if the character is lowercase and 0 otherwise.

- `4-isalpha.c`: This program defines a function that checks if a given character is alphabetic or not. It returns 1 if the character is a letter, either uppercase or lowercase, and 0 otherwise.

- `5-sign.c`: This program defines a function that prints the sign of a given number. It returns 1 if the number is positive, -1 if it is negative, and 0 if it is zero.

- `6-abs.c`: This program defines a function that computes the absolute value of a given integer.

- `7-print_last_digit.c`: This program defines a function that prints the last digit of a given number.

- `8-24_hours.c`: This program prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.

- `9-times_table.c`: This program prints the 9 times table, starting from 0 up to 9.

- `10-add.c`: This program defines a function that adds two integers and returns the result.

- `11-print_to_98.c`: This program prints all natural numbers from a given number up to 98, separated by commas.
